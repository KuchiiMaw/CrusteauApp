       Handcraft bread workshop Crusteau is the project initiated by Ignasi PÃ©rez-Noguera, rising from the passion, the dedication for the job and the product, and the will to give the people of Tarragona bread for them to be proud of.\n

\nComing from the culture of self-supply and DIY, honing techniques in England and discovering millenial cereals in South America, with a scientific vision and an artisan point of view, Crusteau is a bread workshop where the only ingredients needed are flour, water, salt and time.\n

\nUsing ecologic flours, milled in stone mills, non-refined salt and mother dough (without additional yeast), through a completely manual process a quality bread of high nutritional value and easy to digest is made.\n

A honest bread, true bread.
